## Motivation

The cosmos has always fascinated scientists, philosophers, and curious minds throughout history. Choosing the theme **"Cosmos"** allows exploring this fascination and discovering new information about the universe.  
Space research is vital for understanding the cosmos and developing technologies that help us utilize Earth's resources efficiently.  

The Solar System, as the immediate universe around us, serves as an accessible example to understand the formation and evolution of celestial objects and offers insights into Earth's evolution and possible future.
